# RDD-EDS
Background Information:
This is a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) study of Swedish nuclear energy production amid an energy policy change in June 2023.
The policy change broadened the focus of energy production from "renewable" to "clean", thus allowing for more nuclear production.
We aim to study the statistical and economic impacts of this policy change utilizing RDD.

# RDD_Sweden_Nuclear
Background Information:
This is a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) study of Swedish nuclear energy production amid an energy policy change in June 2023. The implemented policy broadened the focus of energy production from 'renewable' to 'clean', thus allowing for more nuclear production. I aim to study the statistical and economic impacts of this policy change utilizing RDD.

This work was initially conducted as part of the ECON32252 Econometrics and Data Science (Prof. Ralf Becker) empricial project assignment, and was done alongside fellow students Aurick Angsana and Yousuf Rashid. Since then, I have expanded the work to incorporate more advanced tools and analysis. 

Data Sources & Reproducibility:
The data used in this study are obtained from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) Transparency Platform, (available at https://transparency.entsoe.eu/dashboard/show) which provides publicly accessible electricity market and generation data across Europe. The data is accessible to all and downloadable to those that log-in with a valid istitutional email address. If logged in, the "Extra_Sweden_RDD.R" file provides step by step instructions on downloading the datasets -- allowing for complete reproducibility of the analysis, and runs dataset merging, cleaning, and pre-processing. The "Sweden_RDD.R" file runs the core RDD analysis.

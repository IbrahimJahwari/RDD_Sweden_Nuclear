# Nuclear Energy Policy Impact in Sweden: A Sharp RDD Approach

Objectives - This paper examines the short-run effects of a regulatory reclassification of nuclear energy in Sweden’s electricity market. On June 1, 2023, the Swedish government redefined nuclear power as a "fossil-free" source under its national climate and energy policy. The reform formally integrated nuclear generation into Sweden’s decarbonization targets without introducing new subsidies, operational mandates, or pricing reforms. We investigate whether this symbolic and institutional shift, absent any financial incentives, produced a measurable change in electricity production behavior. The setting provides a rare opportunity to isolate the effects of regulatory signaling on firm behavior in a capital-intensive and politically sensitive sector.

Methods - The analysis employs a sharp regression discontinuity design centered on the policy implementation date. Using high-frequency administrative data from the Swedish transmission system operator, we estimate the causal effect of the reclassification on daily nuclear output in a narrow window around the threshold. The identification strategy relies on the assumption that, absent the reform, the conditional expectation of nuclear production would have evolved smoothly through the cutoff. The regression model uses a local linear specification with a triangular kernel and bandwidth selection based on mean squared error minimization. Robustness checks include alternative bandwidths, higher-order polynomial specifications, and placebo tests.

Results - The main estimate indicates an increase of approximately 19,837 MWh in daily nuclear production following the policy change. The result is statistically significant and robust to alternative modeling assumptions. Sensitivity tests confirm that the estimated discontinuity persists under varying bandwidths and functional forms. Placebo tests using electricity generation from fossil, hydro, wind, and solar sources show no discontinuities at the cutoff, supporting the specificity of the effect. Estimates at placebo cutoff dates in 2022 and 2024 do not replicate the main finding. Although fixed effects and seasonality controls attenuate the estimate and reduce precision, the direction and economic magnitude remain consistent.

Discussion - The findings suggest that legal and institutional classification can affect firm behavior in electricity markets, even in the absence of new financial incentives. The observed increase in nuclear output is consistent with a reduction in perceived regulatory uncertainty and an adjustment in short-run operational strategy within existing capacity constraints. These results contribute to a broader understanding of how regulatory credibility and institutional signals influence behavior under climate policy. More generally, the study illustrates the value of high-frequency regression discontinuity designs for detecting the effects of symbolic or low-salience policy reforms. The analysis highlights how changes in legal status, when credible and well-defined, can shape production behavior in sectors characterized by long planning horizons and substantial political risk.

Data Sources & Reproducibility:
The data used in this study are obtained from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) Transparency Platform, (available at https://transparency.entsoe.eu/dashboard/show) which provides publicly accessible electricity market and generation data across Europe. The data is accessible to all and downloadable to those that log-in with a valid istitutional email address. Once logged in, the "Extra_Sweden_RDD.R" file provides step by step instructions on downloading the datasets, allowing for complete reproducibility of the analysis! The "Sweden_RDD.R" file uses the generated cleaned and merged dataset (Sweden_RDD.csv) to run the core RDD analysis. The "Sweden_RDD.Rmd" markdown file will also be reproducible using the generated dataset.

# RDD_Sweden_Nuclear

This repository contains the code and report for an empirical study evaluating the effect of Sweden’s 2023 nuclear energy reclassification. The project uses a regression discontinuity design to test for behavioral responses in daily electricity production.

## 📄 Overview

On June 1, 2023, Sweden officially reclassified nuclear energy as a “fossil-free” source. This symbolic legal change was integrated into the country’s climate and energy policy framework.

Using high-frequency generation data from the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform, this study estimates the causal effect of the reclassification on daily nuclear electricity output.
